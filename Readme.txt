Welcome to our earthquake search website! Here you can search for earthquakes in any location between 2023-02-04 and 2023-02-07.

Our website consists of two main sections:

Section One:

=>search box where you can enter the location you want to search for.
      -> The search box also provides a dropdown list of suggested locations.

=>switch button that allows you to change the map mode preview between dark and light.


=>legend that represents the classification of earthquakes power based on their magnitude.
      -> Our classification is based on two criteria: [color and radius size].
                                                  Red represents earthquakes with magnitude greater than 4.5, 
                                                  blue represents earthquakes with magnitude between 3 and 4.5, 
                                                  green represents earthquakes with magnitude less than 3. 

      ->The circles also have different radius sizes based on the magnitude of the earthquake.



Section Two [Map]:

=>The map displays clustered, classified colored circles representing the locations of every earthquake that occurred in the specified time period.
    ->Each circle displays the number of total earthquakes inside the cluster.
=>Clicking on any circle will display a popup containing the average magnitude value of the earthquake and the name of the location where it occurred.

=>The custom defaults of the map include zoom, rotate, full screen, zoom slider, and scale line.
